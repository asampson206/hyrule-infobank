# The Hyrule InfoBank

## Welcome To Your Guide!

Hello! Here I've made a small excerpt from the Encyclopedia of one of my favorite games. It includes valuable information that the player will need when hunting the games monsters.
The star of the show and our main focus is one one of the most fearsome around, The White-Maned Lynel. 

## So What Can You Do?

This webpage is meant to be a short log for potential tourists of the games main setting, Hyrule Kingdom. Reading through the passages will give you hints on how to interact with the webpage.
These interactions give you an idea of what it would be like to encounter the highly aggressive White Lynel.
